The group","consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist/keyboardist John","Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound has","led them to be cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal. Their style drew","from a wide variety of influences, including blues, psychedelia, and folk music.","","After changing their name from the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin signed a deal","with Atlantic Records that afforded them considerable artistic freedom. Although","the group were initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant","commercial success with eight studio albums released over eleven years, from Led","Zeppelin (1969) to In Through the Out Door (1979). Their untitled fourth studio","album, commonly known as Led Zeppelin IV (1971) and featuring the song \"Stairway","to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and","it helped to secure the group's popularity.","","Page wrote most of Led Zeppelin's music, particularly early in their career,","while Plant generally supplied the lyrics. Jones' keyboard-based compositions","later became central to the group's catalogue, which featured increasing","experimentation. The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking","tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although","they remained commercially and critically successful, their output and touring","schedule were limited during the late 1970s, and the group disbanded following","Bonham's death from alcohol-related asphyxia in 1980. In the decades that","followed, the surviving members sporadically collaborated and participated in","one-off Led Zeppelin reunions. The most successful of these was the 2007 Ahmet","Ertegun Tribute Concert in London, with Jason Bonham taking his late father's","place behind the drums.","","Many critics consider Led Zeppelin to be one of the most successful, innovative,","and influential rock groups in history. They are one of the best-selling music","artists in the history of audio recording; various sources estimate the group's","record sales at 200 to 300 million units worldwide. With RIAA-certified sales of","111.5 million units, they are the third-best-selling band in the US. Each of","their nine studio albums placed in the top 10 of the Billboard album chart and","six reached the number-one spot. They achieved eight consecutive UK number-one","albums. Rolling Stone magazine described them as \"the heaviest band of all","time\", \"the biggest band of the Seventies\", and \"unquestionably one of the most","enduring bands in rock history\". They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall","of Fame in 1995; the museum's biography of the band states that they were \"as","influential\" during the 1970s as the Beatles were during the 1960s."],"stylingDirectives":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"colorizedLines":null,"csv":null,"csvError":null,"dependabotInfo":{"showConfigurationBanner":false,"configFilePath":null,"networkDependabotPath":"/IPGP/git_class/network/updates","dismissConfigurationNoticePath":"/settings/dismiss-notice/dependabot_configuration_notice","configurationNoticeDismissed":null},"displayName":"file1.txt","displayUrl":"https://github.com/IPGP/git_class/blob/main/example/file1.txt?raw=true","headerInfo":{"blobSize":"2.79 KB","deleteTooltip":"You must be signed in to make or propose changes","editTooltip":"You must be signed in to make or propose changes","ghDesktopPath":"https://desktop.github.com","isGitLfs":false,"onBranch":true,"shortPath":"389b968","siteNavLoginPath":"/login?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FIPGP%2Fgit_class%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fexample%2Ffile1.txt","isCSV":false,"isRichtext":false,"toc":null,"lineInfo":{"truncatedLoc":"43","truncatedSloc":"39"},"mode":"file"},"image":false,"isCodeownersFile":null,"isPlain":false,"isValidLegacyIssueTemplate":false,"issueTemplate":null,"discussionTemplate":null,"language":"Text","languageID":372,"large":false,"planSupportInfo":{"repoIsFork":null,"repoOwnedByCurrentUser":null,"requestFullPath":"/IPGP/git_class/blob/main/example/file1.txt","showFreeOrgGatedFeatureMessage":null,"showPlanSupportBanner":null,"upgradeDataAttributes":null,"upgradePath":null},"publishBannersInfo":{"dismissActionNoticePath":"/settings/dismiss-notice/publish_action_from_dockerfile","releasePath":"/IPGP/git_class/releases/new?marketplace=true","showPublishActionBanner":false},"rawBlobUrl":"https://github.com/IPGP/git_class/raw/main/example/file1.txt","renderImageOrRaw":false,"richText":null,"renderedFileInfo":null,"shortPath":null,"symbolsEnabled":true,"tabSize":8,"topBannersInfo":{"overridingGlobalFundingFile":false,"globalPreferredFundingPath":null,"showInvalidCitationWarning":false,"citationHelpUrl":"https://docs.github.com/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-citation-files","actionsOnboardingTip":null},"truncated":false,"viewable":true,"workflowRedirectUrl":null,"symbols":{"timed_out":false,"not_analyzed":true,"symbols":[]}},"copilotInfo":null,"copilotAccessAllowed":false,"csrf_tokens":{"/IPGP/git_class/branches":{"post":"wRW1Pc9_kSpHkmr8l6odCd3pbh_47HFwvHgPTMxFFP4iXFG9Q4uVXDurvZChti8fY_meQ-TL88T8Wz0Lfk2vxQ"},"/repos/preferences":{"post":"Y0jmAMex8RpW9jh5vlIExWDGmboJv7Ca2x9IC4c2IyC5MPKoiItB6BtJTgNEfIlNhUag0LP_6yhT97HIHZxmyQ"}}},"title":"git_class/example/file1.txt at main Â· IPGP/git_class"}
